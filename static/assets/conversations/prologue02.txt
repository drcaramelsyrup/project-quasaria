Mragrasohrra rramramra! Sha rrakarra rrasohgraka karra kakagra. Grasoh shamra rra.
{
<!-- Translation: Unidentified shuttle! Your docking credentials are invalid. Identify yourself. -->
}
[[Um... What?!->What?]]
[[I can't understand you!->What?]]

:: What?[Mysterious_Voice]
It's a Dracon. He's telling you that your docking credentials are invalid. He wants you to identify yourself.

[[What's a Dracon?->Dracon?]]
[[How am I supposed to do that?->How?]]
[[Can he understand me?->Can he understand?]]

:: Dracon?[Mysterious_Voice]
That's the word for them that makes the most sense in your language. They're carnivorous, like to eat a lot of meat and fish. Their homeworld is mostly covered in water, but they can move on land as well. And, you know, smart. Predatory at times, but smart.

[[Don't tell me he's going to try to eat me!->Eat me]]
[[You forgot to mention how I'm supposed to communicate with him.->How?]]
[[Great. A smart, predatory alien.->How?]]

:: How?[Mysterious_Voice]
If you do enough talking, his translator should pick up your language. You don't have a translator, though. That might be a problem.

[[Uh-oh. This could be bad.->Second warning]]
[[I'm sick of surprises.->Second warning]]
[[I'll just use body language to communicate.->Second warning]]

:: Can he understand?[Mysterious_Voice]
Probably not, until his translator picks up enough of your language. You don't have a translator though. That might be a problem.

[[Uh-oh. This could be bad.->Second warning]]
[[I'm sick of surprises.->Second warning]]
[[I'll just use body language to communicate.->Second warning]]

:: Eat me[Mysterious_Voice]
No, the Dracon are civilized. They don't prey on sentient beings. And he should figure out that you're sentient, provided you say something intelligent. His translator will work out your language soon enough. But you don't have a translator, which could be a problem.

[[Uh-oh. This could be bad.->Second warning]]
[[I'm sick of surprises.->Second warning]]
[[I'll just use body language to communicate.->Second warning]]

:: Second warning
Rragra gra sha mrasha karra! Mramra sha rrasohgraka, rra mra' rraka sha rramramra ss rramra.
{
<!-- Translation: This is your second warning! Identify yourself, or I will board your shuttle by force. -->
}
[[What's he saying?->Translation]]

:: Translation[Mysterious_Voice]
He's just given you your second warning. He's threatening to board your shuttle by force if you don't provide credentials. Pretty serious about his job, this one.

[[Crap! What do I do?->What do]]
[[Can he wait a minute? I need some time to think.->Need time]]
[[Can't you just tell him what's happening?->You tell him]]

:: What do[Mysterious_Voice]
You're just going to have to talk and hope that his translator picks up your language quickly. It'll be better if he can see you. Letting him board the shuttle might be a good move.

[[Okay. I'll let him board.->Let him board]]
[[No, it's safer if he stays out there.->Are you sure?]]

:: Need time[Mysterious_Voice]
He'll blow the shuttle open if you don't make a move soon. Station Zero is serious about their security.

[[...->What do]]

:: You tell him[Mysterious_Voice]
Private channel, remember? Only you can hear me. And it'll just make things worse if they know I'm here.

[[...->What do]]

:: Let him board

<!-- Fade to black, then back in again with Gleaming Shoal's avatar present in the shuttle scene. -->
}
Gra' mra kagrasoh. Graka, Kismet?
{
<!-- Translation: It's an alien. Right, Kismet? -->
}
[[Hello.->Kismet]]
[[I come in peace.->Kismet]]
[[Alright, let's all calm down now.->Kismet]]

:: Are you sure?[Mysterious_Voice]
I really can't recommend that course of action. Stay silent in here and they're probably going to assume the worst.

[[Fine, I'll let him in.->Let him board]]
[[No. I'll take my chances.->Keep him out]]

:: Keep him out
Kasha mramramra!
{
<!-- Translation: Last warning! -->
}

:: Kismet[Kismet]
Vu shakary' ves sha keika kei kyvulaikeisha.
{
<!-- Translation: It doesn't seem to have a translator. -->
}
[[That one sounds different from the other one.->Different alien]]
[[They're different species, right?->Different alien]]

:: Different alien[Mysterious_Voice]
That's an Asura. Female. The other one, the Dracon... he called her Kismet. She seems to be his employee. Oh, and she's noticed that you don't have a translator.

[[That's good, right?->Good]]
[[Hello, Kismet.->Hello]]
[[Can you two understand me yet?->Understand yet?]]

:: Good

[[Hello? Do you understand me yet?->More speech]]

:: Hello[Kismet]
Ka, vv keika vu Kismet. Vusha keidru lu?

}
[[Yes, Kismet. Is that your name?->More speech]]

<!-- Translation: Okay, I think I have a partial translation. Reversing. Let's see if this works. -->
}
[[Wait, I understood part of that.->I understand]]
